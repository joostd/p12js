# p12js

Generate PKCS#12 file on the client (i.e. in the browser).

# Motivation

To obtain a personal X.509 certificate you need to generate a public/private key pair, and submit the public key to a Certification Authority (CA).
Such a key pair can be generated in your browser using the HTML [KEYGEN element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/keygen).
However, this element will soon be [no longer supported](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2016Jun/0001.html) by modern browsers.
An alternative is to submit a PKCS #10 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to your Certification Authority (CA).
Such a CSR can be generated by tools like [OpenSSL](openssl.org), which require users to be familiar with a command-line interface,
and which is not installed by default on Windows systems.

However,
[modern browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/keygen#Browser_compatibility)
support the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), providing native methods for
[generating key pairs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey).

This allows for a JavaScript implementation of a "wizzard" for generating key pairs, CSRs,
and combining the resulting certificate received from the CA into a PKCS#12 file in a
[standalone, client-size implementation](dist/index.html).

Note that this implementation 

## Required browser features

- Browser support for [execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand).
